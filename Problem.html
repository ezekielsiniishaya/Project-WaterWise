        <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
        <p>"The global water crisis, driven by population growth, urbanization, and unsustainable practices,
            demands
            urgent
            conservation measures to mitigate scarcity. Pollution, exacerbated by industrial discharge and
            agricultural
            runoff, threatens water sources and human health. Climate change intensifies challenges with extreme
            weather
            events, amplifying strain on resources. Lack of awareness impedes mitigation efforts. Education and
            outreach are
            critical to fostering conservation and safeguarding water for future generations.

            <li><strong>Climate Change Impact on Water:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Problem: Climate change exacerbates water-related challenges, leading to intensified extreme
                    weather
                    events such as floods and droughts.</li>
                <li>Impact: These events disrupt water availability and distribution, causing both immediate
                    crises
                    and
                    long-term strain on water resources.</li>

            <li><strong> Industrial Water Waste:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Problem: Industrial activities contribute significantly to water pollution through the
                    discharge
                    of
                    harmful effluents and chemicals into water bodies.</li>
                <li>Impact: This pollution contaminates water sources, jeopardizing ecosystems, human health,
                    and
                    the
                    sustainability of water supplies.</li><img

            <li><strong>Water Pollution:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Problem: Pollution from various sources, including agricultural runoff and plastic waste,
                    poses
                    a
                    significant threat to water quality and ecosystem health.</li>
                <li>Impact: Contaminated water sources endanger aquatic life, compromise drinking water safety,
                    and
                    exacerbate health risks for communities reliant on polluted water.</li><img
