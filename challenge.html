            <h3> Raising Awareness of Sustainability</h3>
            Currently, 3 out of 10 people do not have access to clean drinking water, and many communities are
            threatened by water
            scarcity, which continue to worsen due to increasing population growth and climate change. Only 1% of the
            Earthâ€™s water
            is freshwater, therefore it needs to be managed properly and conserved. Xylem works to address these global
            water issues
            in multiple ways, including through high-impact education activities and awareness campaigns, delivered in
            partnership
            with schools, universities, and youth-focused nonprofit organizations.

            For this challenge, develop an interactive and engaging activity, presentation, or module that will increase
            awareness
            of an important water topic that you select. Your proposed educational module should be informative and
            include calls to
            action that can engage young people and communities in the ongoing work to address the water issues.</p>
