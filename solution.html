        <h2>Our Solution:</h2>
        <p>In order to solve the challenges related to water conservation and recycling here are few proposed solutions:

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Green Infrastructure:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                The best strategy to manage flood water, urban heat effects, and promote sustainability is green
                infrastructure that
                provides an alternative to traditional gray concrete infrastructure by making hard/paved surfaces
                vegetated and
                permeable. When installed at large scale like green roofs or permeable pavements capture rain water
                and retain it on
                site regulates the temperature, provides wildlife habitat, and reduces greenhouse gas reduction
                benefits.

            </ul>
            <li><strong>Precision irrigation system for water conservation:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                Drip irrigation: System that deliver water directly to the root zone of plants, minimizing evaporation
                and run off. For
                this precise farming use of soil and ambient sensors and controllers should be incorporated to precisely
                regulate
                irrigation schedules. We have created a prototype as our final year project: Cyber pysical system for
                precision farming
                ensuring water conservation and precision farming.<br><br>

            </ul>
            <li><strong>Investing in Renewable Energy:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                Transitioning to renewable energy sources help reduce greenhouse gas emmisions contributing to climate
                change,
                incorporating renewable energy solutions, solar powered water pumps, similarly wind powered desalination
                plants as world
                is already moving towards zero carbon focusing on sustainabilty and clean energy.<img

            <li><strong>Industrial waste water treatment techniques:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                The most efficient technique for industrial water treatment and pollution reduction depends on various
                factors,
                including the specific contaminants present in the wastewater, the volume and flow rate of wastewater,
                and economic
                considerations.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Advanced Filtration Technologies:</b><br>

                        Effective for removing a wide range of contaminants, including suspended solids, dissolved
                        solids,
                        and microorganisms.
                        Suitable for industries with complex wastewater compositions requiring high-purity water
                        treatment.
